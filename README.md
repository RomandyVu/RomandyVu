Hi, my name is Romandy and I'm a Computer Science Major who graduated from Grand Valley State University in 2023.

This is my non-school account, though I am wondering why I didn't just use this account instead of my school account for GitHub.

Here's my GitHub account for college: https://github.com/GVSU-Romandy-Vu
